# Predictive Analysis in Diabetes

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- This project focuses on **predictive analysis for diabetes detection** using machine learning models.  
- The goal is to analyze patient data, identify patterns, and build predictive models to help in early diagnosis and prevention.

The notebook contains:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison between models

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy** & **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning models and evaluation metrics

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `Predictive analysis in diabetes.ipynb` â†’ Main notebook containing all code, visualizations, and analysis

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-predictive-analysis.git
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-predictive-analysis

4. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. **Open the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Predictive analysis in diabetes.ipynb"

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Achieved model accuracy and insights on key factors affecting diabetes.
- Visualizations showing relationships between features and diabetes occurrence.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
- Test with larger datasets for better generalization
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions
- Experiment with deep learning approaches
